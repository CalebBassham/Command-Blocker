# Command Blocker

Command Blocker is a small plugin that does just that, block commands. No need to bloat the plugin with anything more. Just make a list of commands
you want to block in the `plugin.yml` (don't include the slashes; in the case of WorldEdit double slash commands, include only one slash) and you're done.
If you would like to change the message players are sent when a command is blocked, you can do that there too (support for '&' colors). There is only one permission,
`commandblocker.bypass`, which *shocker*, allows you to bypass all blocked commands.
